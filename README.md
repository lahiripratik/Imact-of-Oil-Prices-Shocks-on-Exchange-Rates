# Impact of Oil Prices Shocks on Exchange Rates

In this project, I attempted to study multivariate time series analysis using Bayesian inference. 
I have made an attempt to explain the BVAR model employed in this study right from scratch below.

Now that we have understood what the BVAR is, let us jump into the equations and coefficients I have tried to predict in the analysis.
The supply side shocks are represented by changed in the variable world oil production and the demand side shocks have been represented by changes in global economic activity.
